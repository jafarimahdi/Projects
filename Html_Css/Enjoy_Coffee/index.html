                        Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee
                        beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species.
                        When coffee berries turn from green to bright red in
                        color – indicating ripeness – they are picked,
                        processed, and dried.[2] Dried coffee seeds (referred to
                        as "beans") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on
                        the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then
                        brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage
                        known as coffee.<br />

                        Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and
                        has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its
                        caffeine content.[3] It is one of the most popular
                        drinks in the world,[4] and can be prepared and
                        presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French
                        press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It
                        is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee
                        is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are
                        often used to lessen the bitter taste<br />

                        Clinical research indicates that moderate coffee
                        consumption is benign or mildly beneficial as a
                        stimulant in healthy adults, with continuing research on
                        whether long-term consumption reduces the questionable
                        credibility.[5] The earliest credible evidence of
                        coffee-drinking as the modern beverage appears in
                        modern-day Yemen in southern Arabia in the middle of the
                        15th century in Sufi shrines where coffee seeds were
                        first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to how it
                        is now prepared for drinking.[1] The Yemenis procured
                        the coffee beans from the Ethiopian Highlands and began
                        cultivation. By the 16th century, the drink had reached
                        the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later
                        spreading to Europe.
